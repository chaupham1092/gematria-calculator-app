# Documentation Policy

## NO UNNECESSARY DOCUMENTATION

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do not create unnecessary documentation files unless absolutely required for functionality.

### What NOT to create:
- Summary documents of completed work
- Progress reports or completion summaries
- Redundant README files
- Change logs unless specifically requested
- Feature documentation unless part of the actual feature requirement

### Only create docs when:
- User explicitly requests documentation
- Documentation is required for the feature to function (e.g., API docs, setup guides)
- Technical documentation is needed for complex integrations

### Keep it minimal:
- If documentation is needed, make it concise and actionable
- Focus on essential information only
- Avoid verbose explanations of what was accomplished
