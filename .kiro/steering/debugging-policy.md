# Debugging Policy

## NO CACHE/RESTART FIXES

**CRITICAL RULE**: Never suggest "clear cache" or "restart" as a solution to code errors.

### When facing errors:
- Find and fix the actual root cause in the code
- Check for syntax errors, import issues, or compatibility problems
- Compare with working code patterns in the same project
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Expo Go

### The fix must be in the code itself, not in the environment.
